### **Web**

This is the overarching theme, covering the technologies and practices used to build, debug, and secure websites and web applications.

### **1. DevTools (Developer Tools)**

DevTools are a set of tools built directly into modern web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that allow developers to inspect and debug a web page. They are absolutely essential for front-end development.

#### **a. Inspector (css box model)**
*   **What it is:** The Inspector (often called the "Elements" tab in Chrome) lets you see the HTML structure (the DOM - Document Object Model) of a page and the CSS styles applied to each element.
*   **How it's used:** You can select any element on the page and see exactly which CSS rules are affecting it, where they come from, and how they cascade. You can also edit the HTML and CSS live in the browser to experiment with changes without altering your source files.
*   **CSS Box Model:** This is a crucial concept that the Inspector helps you visualize. Every HTML element is considered a box with four layers:
    1.  **Content:** The actual text, image, or other media.
    2.  **Padding:** The transparent space around the content, inside the border.
    3.  **Border:** A line that goes around the padding and content.
    4.  **Margin:** The transparent space around the border, separating the element from other elements.
    The Inspector has a visual diagram showing the size of each of these layers for the selected element, making it easy to debug layout issues.

#### **b. Console**
*   **What it is:** The Console is an interactive command line for JavaScript.
*   **How it's used:**
    *   **Viewing Logs:** Developers use `console.log()` in their JavaScript code to print out messages, variable values, or objects to help with debugging.
    *   **Error Reporting:** The browser automatically reports JavaScript errors, security warnings, and other issues in the console.
    *   **Running Code:** You can type and execute JavaScript directly in the console to test functions, manipulate the current page, or check the value of variables.

#### **c. Debugger (breakpoints)**
*   **What it is:** The Debugger (often in the "Sources" tab) is a powerful tool for analyzing your JavaScript code as it runs.
*   **How it's used:** Instead of just guessing what your code is doing with `console.log()`, you can pause its execution at specific points.
*   **Breakpoints:** A breakpoint is a line of code you mark in the debugger. When the browser's JavaScript engine reaches that line, it **pauses** execution completely. While paused, you can:
    *   Inspect the values of all variables at that exact moment.
    *   "Step through" the code one line at a time to see how things change.
    *   Trace the "call stack" to see which functions led to the current point.

#### **d. Network**
*   **What it is:** The Network tab records every single network request the browser makes to load a page. This includes HTML files, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript scripts, images, fonts, and API calls.
*   **How it's used:** For each request, you can see:
    *   **Status Code:** (e.g., `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
    *   **Method:** (e.g., `GET`, `POST`).
    *   **Size:** How large the requested file was.
    *   **Time:** How long it took to download.
    *   **Headers & Payload:** The detailed request and response headers, and the data sent or received.
    This is critical for diagnosing slow-loading pages or figuring out why an API call is failing.

#### **e. Lighthouse**
*   **What it is:** An automated open-source tool from Google for auditing the quality of web pages.
*   **How it's used:** You run a Lighthouse audit (it's a tab in Chrome DevTools), and it generates a report with scores from 0-100 in five key areas:
    1.  **Performance:** How fast does the page load and become interactive?
    2.  **Accessibility:** Can people with disabilities use the page?
    3.  **Best Practices:** Does the page follow modern web development standards?
    4.  **SEO (Search Engine Optimization):** Is the page optimized to be found by search engines?
    5.  **PWA (Progressive Web App):** Does the site meet the criteria to be a PWA?
    The report also provides specific suggestions on how to improve your scores.

### **2. Server Security**

This section covers the practices and principles for protecting your web server, application, and user data from attacks.

#### **a. Whitelist**
*   **What it is:** A security strategy where you define a list of **everything that is allowed**, and everything else is automatically denied. It's a "default deny" approach.
*   **Example:** For an admin dashboard, you could create an IP whitelist containing only the IP addresses of your office. Any login attempt from an IP address not on that list would be blocked, even with the correct password.

#### **b. Blacklist**
*   **What it is:** The opposite of a whitelist. You define a list of **specific things that are denied**, and everything else is allowed. It's a "default allow" approach.
*   **Example:** If you notice a specific IP address is trying to hack your site, you can add it to a blacklist to block it.
*   **Comparison:** Whitelisting is generally more secure because you only have to manage what's good, whereas with blacklisting, you have to constantly try to identify and block all possible bad things, which is much harder.

#### **c. Captchas (DOS/DDOS mitigation, How to differentiate between attack and high traffic?)**
*   **What it is:** CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart." It's a challenge (like identifying distorted text or clicking on all the traffic lights) that is easy for humans but difficult for automated bots.
*   **DOS/DDOS Mitigation:** A Denial-of-Service (DOS) or Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDOS) attack is when an attacker floods your server with so many requests that it gets overwhelmed and can't serve legitimate users. Since these attacks are run by bots, placing a CAPTCHA on high-traffic forms (like login or search) can block the bots from making repeated, resource-intensive requests.
*   **How to differentiate between an attack and high traffic?** This is a critical and difficult question.
    *   **High Traffic (Legitimate):** Usually has diverse IP addresses from all over, follows normal user navigation patterns, and has a variety of "user-agent" strings (identifying different browsers and devices).
    *   **Attack Traffic (e.g., DDOS):** Often comes from a smaller set of IPs (or a botnet with identifiable patterns), requests the same resource over and over at an unnatural speed, and may use a single, unusual user-agent.
    *   **Tools use multiple signals:** Modern firewalls and DDOS protection services analyze traffic patterns, IP reputation, request rates per IP, and other heuristics to distinguish between the two. If traffic is deemed suspicious, it can be throttled (rate-limited) or challenged with a CAPTCHA.

#### **d. Secure coding practices (SQL injection)**
*   **What it is:** A set of rules and techniques developers must follow to prevent security vulnerabilities in their code.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** This is a classic and very dangerous attack. It happens when an attacker can "inject" their own SQL commands into a query your application sends to the database.
    *   **Vulnerable Code Example:** `query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + userInput + "';"`. If a user enters `' OR '1'='1`, the final query becomes `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR '1'='1';`, which will return **all** users because `'1'='1'` is always true.
    *   **Prevention:** The primary way to prevent SQLi is to **never** trust user input and to use **prepared statements (or parameterized queries)**. This separates the SQL command from the user data, so the database treats the user input as pure data, not as part of the command. Input validation and sanitization are also important.

#### **e. Proper configuration/Avoid misconfiguration (FTP anonymous account)**
*   **What it is:** Many security breaches happen not because of a brilliant hack, but because a server, service, or application was set up incorrectly, leaving a door open.
*   **Example: FTP anonymous account:** FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used to transfer files. Some FTP servers can be configured to allow "anonymous" access, meaning anyone can log in without a password. If an anonymous account has permissions to write or delete files, an attacker can easily deface the website or upload malicious code. This setting should almost always be disabled on a production server.
*   **Other Examples:** Using default passwords, leaving server error messages on (which can leak information), having unnecessary ports open to the internet.

#### **f. Tech stack exploits (security vulnerabilities in older versions)**
*   **What it is:** Your "tech stack" is the collection of software you use (e.g., Linux OS, Apache web server, MySQL database, PHP/Python language, WordPress/Django framework). All software has bugs, and some of these are security vulnerabilities.
*   **The Danger:** When a vulnerability is discovered, the creators release a patch or a new version to fix it. Attackers actively scan the internet for servers running old, unpatched versions of software with known vulnerabilities. If you don't keep your entire tech stack updated, you are an easy target.

#### **g. Proper authorization**
*   **What it is:** This is about controlling what a logged-in user is allowed to do. It's often confused with **Authentication**, which is the process of verifying who a user is (e.g., checking a username and password).
*   **Authorization vs. Authentication:**
    *   **Authentication:** "Are you User Bob?"
    *   **Authorization:** "Okay, you are User Bob. Are you allowed to access the admin panel?"
*   **Importance:** A common vulnerability is "broken access control," where the application fails to check if a user has the right permissions. For example, a regular user might be able to access an admin-only URL (`/admin/deleteUser?id=123`) just by typing it in their browser if the server doesn't check their role.

### **3. PHP**

*   **What it is:** PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular open-source, server-side scripting language. "Server-side" means the PHP code is executed on the web server, not in the user's browser.
*   **What it's used for:** Its primary use is to create dynamic web pages. It can interact with databases (like MySQL) to fetch data, process form submissions, manage user sessions, and generate HTML content that is then sent to the user's browser. It's the language that powers huge platforms like WordPress and Facebook (originally).

### **4. WAMP, XAMPP**

*   **What they are:** These are free, easy-to-install software packages that provide a complete local web development environment. They bundle all the necessary components together.
*   **Purpose:** They allow you to run a web server on your personal computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux) to build and test websites without needing an actual live server on the internet.
*   **The Acronyms:**
    *   **WAMP:** Stands for **W**indows, **A**pache, **M**ySQL, **P**HP. It's a package specifically for the Windows operating system.
    *   **XAMPP:** Stands for **X** (meaning cross-platform, it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux), **A**pache, **M**ariaDB (a popular replacement for MySQL), **P**HP, and **P**erl.

By studying these topics, you will have a strong understanding of how to build, debug, and secure a modern web application. Good luck with your final tests
